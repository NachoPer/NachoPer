<p> 
Since my kid's years, technology form a big part of my life, considering that I spent a lot of time in the cybercaf√© of my family. Therefore, my passion for technology and learning about it are always there üòÅ.
</br>
My favorite part of being a developer, it's to find and understand the best experience for the user and also for us the developers with clean code following best practices.
